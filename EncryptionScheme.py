# An English text needs to be encrypted using 
# Edabitâ€™s encryption scheme. First, the spaces 
# are removed from the text. Let L be the length 
# of this text. Then, characters are written into 
# a grid, whose rows and columns have the 
# following constraints:
# For example, the sentence "if man was meant 
# to stay on the ground god would have given us 
# roots", after removing spaces, is 54 characters long.
# The square root of 54 is between 7 and 8, so 
# it is written in the form of a grid with 7 rows and 8 columns.
